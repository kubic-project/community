# Kubic

You can read a short introduction to Kubic on [SUSE's
blog](https://www.suse.com/communities/blog/introducing-kubic-project-new-open-source-project/).

The latest ISO can be downloaded from [openSUSE's
website](http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/).

Since Kubic is an ongoing community effort, the [SUSE CaaS Platform
documentation](https://www.suse.com/betaprogram/caasp-beta/doc-quickstart/) can
be used for now.

If you want to open new issues or participate in fixing them, the place to do
that is [openSUSE's Bugzilla Tumbleweed - Kubic
component](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/buglist.cgi?component=Kubic&list_id=7052689&product=openSUSE%20Tumbleweed&resolution=---).  
The community provides faster and better feedback on Bugzilla so it's encouraged to open issues there, rather than this repository.

You can find more details about [Kubic from the
talk](https://speakerdeck.com/thkukuk/opensuse-kubic-what-is-this-1) that was
given at openSUSE conference 2017 and the video below.

Kubic is a work in progress and we need your help to make it better, if you
find problems with the ISO, please open an issue with this repo.
