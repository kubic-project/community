# Kubic

This repository servers as documentation for the
open source version of SUSE CaaS Platform - Kubic.   
You can read a short introduction to Kubic on [SUSE's
blog](https://www.suse.com/communities/blog/introducing-kubic-project-new-open-source-project/).

The latest ISO can be downloaded from [openSUSE's
website](http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/).

Since Kubic is an ongoing community effort, the [SUSE CaaS Platform
documentation](https://www.suse.com/betaprogram/caasp-beta/doc-quickstart/) can
be used for now.

You can find more details about [Kubic from the
talk](https://speakerdeck.com/thkukuk/opensuse-kubic-what-is-this-1) that was
given at openSUSE conference 2017 and the video below.

Kubic is a work in progress and we need your help to make it better, if you
find problems with the ISO, please open an issue with this repo.
